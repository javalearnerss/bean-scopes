The Spring Framework provides several bean scopes that determine the lifecycle and visibility of beans in the application context:
  1. Singleton
  2. Prototype
  3. Request
  4. Session
  5. Application
  6. WebSocket
     
The last four scopes (request, session, application, and WebSocket) are specifically designed for web applications.

I've just published a deep-dive video explaining the request and session scopes, with hands-on coding examples to help you avoid common pitfalls!"
